# Webpage Designed Per Wireframe

This is a basic project, part of the Codecademy full-stack developer learning path, which contains the following:

* Spec in the form of a wireframe
* html and css files to design the webpage per the wireframe
* Images used in the webpage

## Learning

To set a background image for a h1 tag such that the image is automatically resized to suit the h1 tag, it's better to use the 'background-image' property in css rather than using an img tag in html.
